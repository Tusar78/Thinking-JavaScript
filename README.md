# Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

## What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP) ?
- In my opinion: Many people think that object oriented programming is a language, or tools. But this idea is wrong. Object Oriented Programming is a model, a type of code writing.

- Like Book: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around object rather than "Action" and data rather than "Logic"

## What is Encapsulations?
- In my opinion: Encapsulation is one of the four pillars of Object Oriented Programming. Let us analyze in a simple way with an example. Suppose we have initialized a data called "person" in one of our projects. Good thing there is no problem. But while working on that project for a while, you have initialized another data called "person" in line "1200". What would happen now? Either the new data will overwrite the previous data or it will show a "syntax error". "Encapsulation" has emerged to solve this problem. "Encapsulation" is what keeps data encapsulated. As a result, the data of one scope cannot be accessed from another scope. For example, if we initialize any data within the "class" and then privatize that data, then that data cannot be accessed from outside the "class". The same thing happens with "function scope". These are the characteristics of "encapsulation".
