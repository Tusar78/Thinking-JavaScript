# Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

## What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP) ?
- In my opinion: Many people think that object oriented programming is a language, or tools. But this idea is wrong. Object Oriented Programming is a model, a type of code writing.

- Like Book: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around object rather than "Action" and data rather than "Logic"
